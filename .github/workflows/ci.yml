# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # dev 브랜지로 바꿔도 됨
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build" #이름은 내맘대루 아닌가?
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest #job이 구동될 환경 

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job #실행 순서 
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      #actions는 github action에서 제공하는 코드 모음집
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
